Description:
A web application for users to sign up and manage the players, teams, and brands present in a typical sports league.   

Details for teaching team: I decided to use routes almost exclusively, but I would probably do it with RESTful routing if I started over.

Outside code:
Foobooks code for authentication and obtaining ID/name pairs was used.
